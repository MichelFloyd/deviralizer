# The Deviralizer
 A chrome extension that hides viral content/clickbait in facebook
 This lets you concentrate on content you really care about such as
 posts from your friends and family!

 To create a zip file for publishing on the chrome extension store:

 $ zip -r deviralizer.zip . -x "README.md" -x ".*" -x "*/*.xcf" -x ".git/*" -x "*.zip"
